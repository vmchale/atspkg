**atspkg** is configured with Dhall, in an atspkg.dhall file. **atspkg** can be
configured to produce binary targets, static library targets, shared object
files, or plain C targets. Artifacts can be linked against Haskell libraries if
desired.

There is also a file $HOME/.config/atspkg/config.dhall which can be used to
configure all builds.

## TEMPLATES

There are several templates available for **pi** (see
https://crates.io/crates/project_init for more details). Several examples:
